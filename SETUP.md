# Photobooth Mini App Setup Guide

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
2. **Set up environment variables** (see below)
3. **Run development server**: `npm run dev`
4. **Open in World App** on your mobile device

## üîë Required Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with these variables:

### World ID Configuration (Required)
```bash
# Your World ID App ID (starts with 'app_')
WLD_APP_ID=app_your_app_id_here

# Your World ID Action ID for verification
NEXT_PUBLIC_WLD_ACTION_ID=your_action_id_here
```

### Optional World ID Settings
```bash
# Signal for verification (can be empty string)
NEXT_PUBLIC_WLD_SIGNAL=

# Verification level (Orb or Device)
NEXT_PUBLIC_WLD_VERIFICATION_LEVEL=Orb
```

### Irys Configuration (For Photo Upload)
```bash
# Your Solana wallet private key for Irys mainnet (keep this secret!) - SERVER SIDE ONLY
SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY=your_solana_private_key_here

# Irys gateway for viewing uploaded content
NEXT_PUBLIC_IRYS_GATEWAY=https://uploader.irys.xyz

# Note: Using Solana mainnet - you need real SOL to upload files
# Get SOL from exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, or other crypto exchanges
```

## üåç World ID Setup

1. Go to [World ID Developer Portal](https://developer.worldcoin.org/)
2. Create a new app
3. Copy your App ID (starts with `app_`)
4. Create a new action for verification
5. Copy your Action ID
6. Add both to your `.env.local` file

## üì± Irys Mainnet Setup

1. Go to [Irys Documentation](https://docs.irys.xyz/)
2. Set up a Solana wallet (Phantom, Solflare, etc.)
3. Get your private key for the Solana wallet
4. **Get real SOL tokens** - This is crucial for uploads to work on mainnet
5. Add the configuration to your `.env.local` file

**Important**: 
- The Solana private key is server-side only (no `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix) for security
- We're using Solana mainnet, which requires real SOL tokens
- You can buy SOL from exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, or Kraken
- **You need SOL tokens in your wallet for uploads to work**

### Getting SOL Tokens

To get SOL tokens, you can:
1. Buy SOL from cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, or Kraken
2. Transfer SOL from another wallet
3. Use a Solana faucet (for small amounts)

**Note**: Without SOL tokens in your wallet, photo uploads will fail with "402 error: Not enough balance for transaction".

## üì± Testing the App

### Desktop Testing
- The app will show a message to open on mobile
- Verification button will be disabled
- Good for development and testing UI

### Mobile Testing
1. Open the app in **World App**
2. Navigate to your mini app
3. Click "Verify with World ID"
4. Complete the verification process
5. Use the photo upload features

## üé® Design Features

- **Mobile-First**: Optimized for mobile devices
- **Black & White**: Minimal, tasteful aesthetic
- **Touch-Friendly**: Large buttons and smooth interactions
- **iOS Optimized**: Prevents scroll bounce
- **Fast Loading**: Optimized for 2-3 second load times
- **Instagram-Like**: Familiar photo upload interface

### Key Components
- **MiniKitProvider**: Initializes World ID MiniKit
- **VerifyButton**: Handles user verification
- **PhotoUpload**: Instagram-like photo upload interface
- **PhotoGallery**: Displays uploaded photos
- **Home Page**: Main app interface with verification and upload flow

## üì∏ Photo Upload Features

### **Upload Methods**
- **Gallery**: Select photos from device gallery
- **Camera**: Take new photos directly in the app
- **File**: Upload image files

### **Irys Integration**
- **Testnet Storage**: Photos stored on Irys testnet (devnet)
- **Decentralized**: No central server stores your photos
- **Permanent**: Once uploaded, photos are permanently stored
- **Verifiable**: Each photo has a unique transaction ID

### **Upload Process**
1. User verifies identity with World ID
2. Selects upload method (gallery/camera/file)
3. Chooses or captures photo
4. Photo is uploaded to Irys testnet via API route
5. Photo appears in personal gallery
6. Photos can be viewed via Irys gateway

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"App ID not configured"**
   - Check your `WLD_APP_ID` environment variable
   - Make sure it starts with `app_`

2. **"Action ID not configured"**
   - Check your `NEXT_PUBLIC_WLD_ACTION_ID` environment variable
   - Verify it's set correctly

3. **"Solana private key not configured"**
   - Check your `SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable
   - Make sure it's server-side only (no `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix)

4. **Verification fails**
   - Ensure you're testing in World App
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify your World ID app configuration

5. **Photo upload fails**
   - Check Solana configuration in environment variables
   - Ensure you have sufficient SOL balance for uploads
   - Verify your wallet has real SOL (not testnet tokens)
   - **Ensure you have SOL tokens in your wallet** (most common issue)
   - Check server logs for detailed error messages
   - If you see "402 error: Not enough balance", you need to fund your wallet with SOL tokens
   - If you see "funding failed", check your wallet has sufficient SOL tokens for funding

6. **"Funding failed" or "Tx doesn't exist" errors**
   - This indicates your wallet doesn't have enough SOL tokens
   - Get SOL tokens from cryptocurrency exchanges
   - Ensure your private key is correct and corresponds to a funded wallet
   - Check the Solana explorer at [explorer.solana.com](https://explorer.solana.com)

### Debug Mode

The app includes console logging for debugging:
- MiniKit initialization status
- Verification request details
- Photo upload progress and results
- API response information

## üìã Next Steps

After setting up verification and photo upload:

1. **Test the complete flow** on mobile
2. **Add photo management** (delete, edit, organize)
3. **Implement social features** (sharing, commenting)
4. **Add advanced privacy controls**
5. **Support multiple Irys networks**
